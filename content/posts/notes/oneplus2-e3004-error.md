I have recently installed [LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) custom ROM on my OnePlus2 device to keep on trying new android versions as they come. While installing/updating the OS, I was getting below error on [TWRP](https://twrp.me/) recovery screen.

```
script aborted: E3004: This package is for device: OnePlus2,oneplus2; this device is .
```

To fix this, I updated to the lastest version of [TWRP for OnePlus2](https://dl.twrp.me/oneplus2/).
