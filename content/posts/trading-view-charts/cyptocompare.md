Below is a functional demo of a financial chart using the [Technical Analysis Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/HTML5-stock-forex-bitcoin-charting-library/?feature=technical-analysis-charts) library from [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) and data from [CryptoCompare](https://developers.cryptocompare.com/). The chart plots historical OHLCV data for a crypto coin pair. The data on the chart updates automatically at real time using a web socket connection.
