Below is a functional demo of a financial chart using the [Technical Advanced Charts](https://in.tradingview.com/advanced-charts/) library from [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) and data from [CryptoCompare](https://developers.cryptocompare.com/). The chart plots historical OHLCV (Open High Low Close Volume) data for a crypto coin pair. The data on the chart updates automatically in real-time using a web socket connection. It uses the [Datafeed API](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Datafeed-API) to integrate with the TradingView charting library.
